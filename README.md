# LSTM Continuation of Bach's Fugue

## Overview
Project BACH is an experiment in algorithmic music composition using deep learning. The goal is to continue Johann Sebastian Bach's unfinished fugue [(_Contrapunctus 14_)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbM3VTIvOBk&ab_channel=fabian1333) by training an LSTM neural network on the original score and generating plausible musical continuations.

## Data
- **Source:** The dataset consists of a 4-voice, text-converted part of Bach's unfinished _Contrapunctus 14_.
- **Format:** The input data (`data/input.txt`) is a symbolic representation of the music, suitable for sequence modeling.
- **Preprocessing:** The data was tokenized and formatted for input into a neural network, with each voice represented as a separate sequence.

## Model
- **Architecture:** The model is a multi-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network implemented in TensorFlow Keras.
- **Training:** The network was trained to predict the next sequence of notes given a preceding context, learning from the structure and style of Bach's original fugue.
- **Output:** The trained model generates new musical sequences that stylistically continue the original piece.

## Listen to the Results
Below you can listen to a 25-second sample generated by the model, as well as the full piece where the generated sample is concatenated to the original fugue.
